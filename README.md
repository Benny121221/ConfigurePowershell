# ConfigurePowershell
A command-line tool for creating a PowerShell profile

## Demonstration
Before doing anything, run ConfigurePowershell.py, this will create a config file in the same directory as it. Edit the config file as appropriate.

The `profile_filepath` can be found by typing `$profile` into a powershell window and copy-pasting the result.

A `config.json` file like this:

```
{
    "profile_filepath": "C:/Users/benny/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1",
    "git_branch_prompt": true,
    "aliases": [
      ["g", "git"]
    ]
}
```

Will yield a powershell profile like this:

```ps1
# Put any of your own custom code outside the code block below

# WHERE1 AUTOGENERATED CODE BEGIN

function prompt{
    $host.ui.rawui.WindowTitle = $(get-location)

    if(Test-Path .git) {
        git branch | foreach {
            if ($_ -match "^\*(.*)"){
                Write-Host ($matches[1] + " ") -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow
            }
        }
    }

    Write-Host ($pwd.path + ">") -NoNewline
    
    return " "     # Don't want to return anything, or it will be written too
                   # However, you need to return a string
}

Set-Alias g git

# WHERE1 AUTOGENERATED CODE END

```
